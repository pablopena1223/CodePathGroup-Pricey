## Overview
### Description
A price comparer that lets you compare prices of items. Might have to stick to 1 category (like let’s say household items) only because I’m not so sure if the API I researched can look at any item, but the whole point is to help people that may want to just find their cheapest option.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking / Saving / Shopping
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile, can then later on be presented as a website. Functionality would be limited to iPhone users (IOS version may vary).
- **Story:** Why should we have to pay $60+ for jeans, when we can get the exact same pair for less? Everyone love's shopping and saving money at the same time. This app does just that 
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app. It's a safe enviornment. Age might be required if you want to buy things online, among other things. 
- **Habit:**This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how long they want to search for, other things they want to look into, etc...
- **Scope:** First we would start with searches about certain items, then present the user with the same or similar items at a lower price and where they can buy it.
